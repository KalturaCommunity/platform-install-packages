Required RPMS for build
=======================
rpm-build gcc gcc-c++ git redhat-rpm-config svn

GIT repo
========
# git clone https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages

~/rpmbuild dir structure
========================
To setup your build ENV please see here:
http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment

platform-install-packages/RPM/.rpmmacros
========================================
This file specifies vars used in the RPM spec files, currently holds versions of supporting components, for instance, kaltura-kmc needs to know what kmc-login ver to take, etc.
When components are upgraded, this file needs to be edited.
In the build ENV, it should reside at ~/.rpmmacros

platform-install-packages/RPM/scripts/build dir
================================================
sources.rc - this file has the ENV vars needed for building from sources. When versions of components are upgraded, they should be modified there.
package_*.sh - each component has a wrapper script that fetches the sources from the needed version and packages them so that the RPM can be built.

Utility scripts
===============
push_rpm.sh - scp the RPM to repo origin and sign it over SSH, then, generate meta data with create repo
bounce_core_ver.sh

Biweekly deployment instructions
================================
Each deployment has instructions here:
https://kaltura.atlassian.net/wiki/display/QAC/QA.Core+Production+Deployments
That includes the new versions for updated components as well as PHP/SQL scripts to run.
The versions should be updated in platform-install-packages/RPM/scripts/build/sources.rc

Step by step release process
============================
0. Create the version directory under 54.211.235.142:/var/www/html/releases:
# mkdir /var/www/html/releases/$CORE_VER/RPMS/noarch
The x86_64 repo is the same for all versions so no need to clone each time, symlink instead:
# ln -s /var/www/html/releases/x86_64 /var/www/html/releases/$CORE_VER/RPMS/
Copy the noarch RPMs that did not change during this release from  /var/www/html/releases/$PREV_CORE_VER/RPMS/noarch, no point in rebuilding them:
# cp /var/www/html/releases/$PREV_CORE_VER/RPMS/noarch/*rpm /var/www/html/releases/$CORE_VER/RPMS/noarch 
Generate metadata with:
# createrepo  /var/www/html/releases/$CORE_VER/RPMS/noarch/


1. read instructions at: https://kaltura.atlassian.net/wiki/display/QAC/QA.Core+Production+Deployments

2. update versions in platform-install-packages/RPM/scripts/build/sources.rc and ~/.rpmmacros if applicable.

3. if ~/.rpmmacros was updated, also commit under platform-install-packages/RPM/.rpmmacros

4. run platform-install-packages/RPM/scripts/build/bounce_core_ver.sh $NEW_VER
This will update the Core version in the various relevant spec files

5. update specs for additional components according to versions in the deployment doc, i.e:
if KMC is of a new version then update 'Version' in kaltura-kmc.spec, for kdp3, update kaltura-kdp3.spec, etc

6. Add changelog entries according to what is stated in the deployment doc to each component, for instance this is one for kaltura-base - the Core package:
- Ver Bounce to 9.13.0
- PLAT-307 - FFMpeg 2.1.3 integration 
- PLAT-914 - FileSyncImport - re-use curl 
- PLAT-558 - Live streaming should support multiple stream ingest 
- PLAT-932 - Production admin_console: "View History" doesn't work 
- PLAT-1003 - E-mail for notification ,configurable fields override default values 
- SUP-1567 - Problem to duplicate KSR from admin console. 
- SUP-1625 - Avoid creating notification jobs when no notification email is configured

7. for the modified components, run the respective package_*.sh script, for instance, if KMC was updated run:
platform-install-packages/RPM/scripts/build/package_kaltura_kmc.sh
for KDP3 run:
platform-install-packages/RPM/scripts/build/package_kaltura_kdp3.sh
and so on.
If a new package is introduces, make sure to create a wrapper script for it as well, in addition to the RPM spec file. 

8. The package_*.sh scripts will retrieve the source archive from GIT/SVN/else and place it in the ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES dir.
Then the script triggers:
$ rpmbuild -ba $SPEC
if the source retrieval succeeded but build failed, you can simply correct what needs correction and then run:
$ rpmbuild -ba $SPEC 
one more, no need to repackage for that.

9. once all RPMs are built, use: 
$ platform-install-packages/RPM/scripts/build/push_rpm.sh /path/to/rpm
this will push the RPMs to the origin server using SCP, sign it and generate new metadata with createrepo.
